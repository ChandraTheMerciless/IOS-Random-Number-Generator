    //write function to bind displayed number to what's returned from btn click function event
    //??????---------I created two side by side labels, so one could only display number field. Would it be better to have results: # all in same label somehow? ASK ERIC--------??????
    
    
    //??????-----ASK ERIC ABOUT WHETHER THAT BOTTOM BTN BAR IS PART OF ASSIGNMENT------??????
